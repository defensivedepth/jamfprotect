# FILE NAMING CONVENTION
# The naming convention to use for any preference files created throughout this workflow.  This will be used for preference files so must be in domain naming format, such as 'com.acmesoft.isolate' and will often be followed by .plist, as an exmaple.
# IMPORTANT: This value must match the value used for the same variable in the enforce stage of this incident response workflow.

# USER NOTIFICATION SETTINGS
# This script will use the 'mac-ibm-notifications' tool to display an information window to the end-user about the event.  A signed and notarised version of this application can be downloaded from https://github.com/IBM/mac-ibm-notifications/releases and should be present on the device in order for it to be used.

# "no" = the user will not be notified and all actions will be silent
